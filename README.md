# Calculator App with React and Redux

## Test application for Nematjon Abdulloev

In this application I have satisfied all requirements except one. The issue was how browsers work.
Due to cross origin resource sharing restrictions, I could not accomplish the Wolfram Alpha task.
Though, all client-side features were implemented such as toggling button and Redux logic to storing response data.
A couple unit tests with setup were implemented as well.

### The app does these calculations:
* Addition
* Subtraction
* Multiplication
* Division
* Unary minus
* Parentheses
* Exponentiation
* Square root extraction
