# Calculator App with React and Redux

## Test application for Nematjon Abdulloev

In this application I have satisfied all requirements except one. The issue was how browsers are working.
To due to cross origin resource sharing restrictions, I could not accomplish the Wolfram Alpha task till finish.
Though, all browser side features were implemented such toggling button and Redux logic to storing that data.
Also couple basic unit tests with setup were implemented as well.
